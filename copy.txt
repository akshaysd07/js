
COPY BY VALUE:
In a primitive data-type when a variable is assigned a value we can imagine that a box is created in the memory. 
This box has a sticker attached to it i.e. the variable name. Inside the box the value assigned to the variable is stored.
 
ex, var x=10;
    var y=20;
    var a=x;
    var b=y;

COPY BY REFERECE:
In case of a non-primitive data-type the values are not directly copied. 
When a non-primitive data-type is assigned a value a box is created with a 
sticker of the name of the data-type. 
However, the values it is assigned is not stored directly in the box. 
The language itself assigns a different memory location to store the data.

ex. let user={name:'ram'};
    let admin= user;
    admin.name ='shyam';
    alert(user.name);
